# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project

##This repository contains the following:
1. This README.md file
2. A Raw Datasets folder containing the original "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" dataset from Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, et al. This data is used to generate the Tidy Datasets below.
3. A Tidy Datasets folder containing the final tiny datasets for this project. There are two tidy data sets included in this folder: 
  1. all-data.csv, which contains the complete dataset, and, 
  2. averaged-data.csv, which summarizes all-data.csv by averaging each variable for each activity and each subject.
4. An R script, run_analysis.R, which was used to get from the raw data to the tiny data.
5. A code book, CodeBook.md, which contains 

##Instructions:
In order to generate the Tidy Datasets folder with the two final datasets, all-data.csv and averaged-data.csv, just run the run_analysis.R script. No other data processing steps are necessary. Refer to CodeBook.md for descriptions of the variables, the data, and specifics about the transformations performed to clean up the raw data.
